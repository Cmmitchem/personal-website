    <p>Hi, I'm Caroline Mitchem and I am currently a 
        student studying Business Information Systems 
        with a minor in Computer Science and FinTech at 
        TCU and I’m eager to learn more about the possible 
        career opportunities as a BIS major. I aspire to work 
        in the tech industry or an IT department as a product 
        partner manager, software engineer, or app developer 
        where I can cultivate a deeper understanding of 
        problem solving as it relates to the tech industry 
        and business world. </p>
        <p>Throughout my internship at Multiverso in Florence, 
            Italy I created a business development plan for 
            their new IoT software. Multiverso is a coworking 
            space provider based in Florence, but with offices 
            all over Italy. The IoT software, Smart Station, is 
            designed to monitor coworking spaces, while collecting 
            data about electricity, internet access, and air conditioning. 
            While working at Multiverso, I was able to collaborate with 
            their creative and technical team to create a business plan 
            with actionable steps to improve their product development. </p>
            
            <p>Ultimately I would like to work as a IT Consultant or app 
                and web developer, but first I would like to work at an 
                established technology company so I can further develop my 
                strengths of problem solving and collaboration. If any 
                Business Information Systems majors would like to provide 
                me with some guidance: What skills outside of major required 
                classes would you recommend for someone trying to pursue a 
                career in this field?</p>

        <p class="proinfo">I created a business plan over the Summer of 
            2022 for Multiverso in Florence, Italy. 
            This business plan was created to generate actionable goals for 
            the Multiverso staff to follow to grow their new software. Smart Station 
            is an IoT software solution created specifically to manage coworking spaces, 
            I helped create specific goals for the developmental team to follow and
             guidelines to consider when continuing to work on Smart Station.  </p>

                <p class="proinfo">Risky Reels Club was an NFT Slot 
                    Machine App that my roommate and I developed while 
                    taking an IOS Development course. We collaborated 
                    with a faculty advisor, our CodePath teaching 
                    assistant, and a friend who introduced us to NFT 
                    and Blockchain capabilities. To continue our project we met 
                    with web developers, backend developers, investors, 
                    and NFT artists. We  created the app using open 
                    source Ethereum code, GitHub, and Xcode, the project is still 
                    being worked on currently. </p></div>

                    One of my classes at TCU was about the cultural 
                     significance of the Hunger Games and our final 
                     project was to create anything within the skills of 
                     our major that represent a cultural aspect of the 
                     Hunger Games. I decided to create an IOS application 
                     that would have been used by President Snow, the 
                     dictator in the Hunger Games, to promote propaganda. 
                     Throughout my process I studied President Snow's 
                     language, the intimidation tactics in the movies, as
                      well as creating an IOS application from scratch 
                      using Xcode. The URL includes my final presentation
                       as well as videos of the functionality of my app.
