    <p>Hi, I'm Caroline Mitchem and I am currently a 
        student studying Business Information Systems 
        with a minor in Computer Science and FinTech at 
        TCU and Iâ€™m eager to learn more about the possible 
        career opportunities as a BIS major. I aspire to work 
        in the tech industry or an IT department as a product 
        partner manager, software engineer, or app developer 
        where I can cultivate a deeper understanding of 
        problem solving as it relates to the tech industry 
        and business world. </p>
        <p>Throughout my internship at Multiverso in Florence, 
            Italy I created a business development plan for 
            their new IoT software. Multiverso is a coworking 
            space provider based in Florence, but with offices 
            all over Italy. The IoT software, Smart Station, is 
            designed to monitor coworking spaces, while collecting 
            data about electricity, internet access, and air conditioning. 
            While working at Multiverso, I was able to collaborate with 
            their creative and technical team to create a business plan 
            with actionable steps to improve their product development. </p>
            
            <p>Ultimately I would like to work as a IT Consultant or app 
                and web developer, but first I would like to work at an 
                established technology company so I can further develop my 
                strengths of problem solving and collaboration. If any 
                Business Information Systems majors would like to provide 
                me with some guidance: What skills outside of major required 
                classes would you recommend for someone trying to pursue a 
                career in this field?</p>
